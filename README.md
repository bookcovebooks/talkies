## About This Book

In this witty chronicle of Hollywood's tumultuous transition from silent films to talkies, a veteran performer recounts the chaos, comedy, and technical disasters that accompanied the dawn of sound cinema. From microphones hidden under sofas to stars whose voices didn't match their on-screen personas, the author offers an insider's view of an industry turned upside down by technology. With sharp humor and nostalgic charm, this firsthand account captures a pivotal moment when the movies learned to speak—and Hollywood scrambled to keep up. A delightful time capsule of 1920s entertainment culture and the growing pains of cinematic innovation.
